      <p>
        Root ems, are a great way to set font sizes in web design. They offer the advantage of scalable font sizing while removing the hassle of dealing with compounding contexts when using traditional ems. Rems calculate the element's font size according to the font size set for html. Ems calculate the font size according to the parent element. This can lead to unexpected results when nesting multiple elements. By dynamically setting one font size in your page's html element, you can have your fonts scale to different sizes based on any criteria you choose.

          A legendary starship despite its humble origins and deceptively shabby exterior, the Millennium Falcon has played a role in some of the Rebel Alliance's greatest victories over the Empire. On the surface, the Falcon looks like a worn down junker. Beneath its hull, however, she packs many powerful secrets. Its owners have made "special modifications" on the freighter throughout the years, boosting its speed, shielding, and performance to impressive -- and downright illegal -- levels. The Falcon pays a heavy price for these tricks and add-ons. It can be unpredictable, and its reconditioned hyperdrive often fails. Its current captain, Han Solo, has even been seen to restart a failed start-up with a hard knock on a bulkhead with his fist.
